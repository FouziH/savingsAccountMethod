## Methods 
    --Create object behavior using methods 


    Methods                               Fields

    (behavior)                            (state)
    ------------                        ------------
    withdrawal, deposit                    balance


    State tells us what a savings account should know:
        The balance of money available
    

    The behavior tells us what tasks a savings account should be able to perform:
        Depositing - increasing the amount available 
        Withdrawing - decreasing the amount available 
        Checking the balance - displaying the amount available 
        Transaction -- displaying detailed transaction 
    
    Methods are repeatable, modular blocks of code used to accomplish specific tasks
